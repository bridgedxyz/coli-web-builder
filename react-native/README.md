# React Native builder

> This package is under this "coli-web-builder" repository since it follows the basic web standards and almost overlaps the react-builder's implementation

## The runner

> We haven't choose / implemented React Native Executor. The candidates are. [[`Expo`](https://github.com/expo/expo), [`react-native-web`](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)]. Though, expo usees `react-native-web` under the hood. the reasonable choice might be react-native-web if we decide to build light-weight expo compat features ourselves for Bridged ecosystem compatibility.
